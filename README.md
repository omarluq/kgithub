This will search repositories, issues, and pull requests simultaneously and display combined results sorted by most recent activity.

### Advanced Search with Prefixes

Use specific prefixes to target your search to a particular content type:

#### Repository Search
```
repo:react
repo:rails/rails
repo:microsoft
```
- `repo:react` - Searches for repositories with "react" in name or description
- `repo:rails/rails` - Searches for the specific "rails/rails" repository
- Returns up to 15 repository results
- Perfect for finding specific projects or exploring repositories

#### Issue Search
```
issue:bug fix
issue:memory leak
issue:authentication error
```
- Searches for issues across all repositories
- Returns up to 15 issue results
- Great for finding specific problems or tracking issues

#### Pull Request Search
```
pr:feature update
pr:security patch
pr:documentation
```
- Searches for pull requests across all repositories
- Returns up to 15 pull request results
- Useful for reviewing code changes or tracking contributions

### Search Features

- **Real-time Search** - Results appear as you type (after 3+ characters)

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Local Storage Only** - All data is cached locally in your KDE configuration
- **Secure Token Handling** - GitHub tokens are stored securely in KDE's configuration system
- **No External Services** - Direct GitHub API communication only
- **Rate Limit Aware** - Intelligent request throttling to respect GitHub's API limits

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Widget shows "Please configure GitHub token"**

- Ensure you've entered a valid GitHub Personal Access Token in the configuration
- Verify the token has the required scopes (repo, public_repo, read:org)
- Check your GitHub username is correct

**Empty or outdated data**

- Try refreshing manually using the refresh button
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your GitHub token hasn't expired

**Performance issues**

- Increase the refresh interval in settings
- The widget uses intelligent caching to minimize API calls
